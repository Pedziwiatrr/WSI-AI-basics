This repository hosts a collection of foundational tasks in artificial intelligence, implemented in Python. Each task is organized in its own dedicated branch (z1 to z7), focusing on key algorithms and learning strategies. The structure is designed for clarity and ease of navigation, allowing you to explore each concept independently.

Repository Structure

z1: Gradient Descent / Ascent

z2: Evolution Algorithm

z3: Minimax Algorithm

z4: Logistic Regression

z5: Neural Network

z6: Q-Learning

z7: Bayesian Neural Network

README.md

Each branch contains all necessary scripts, data, and documentation for its respective task.
